        Reaper-17: Ground Assault

        Reaper is a sub-faction of Scrin. Scrin is the alien race which brought Tiberium on earth.

        Their aircraft as well as their walkers are slow and heavy. This makes them very good at siege and slow rolling attacks.

        The Reapers have the heaviest arsenal of Scrin specialized for ground invasion. This results in the Stormcrawler and the Heavy Tripod.

        The Stormcrawler soaks up a lot of damage and the Tripod is a heavy assault walker.

        Their epic unit is the Hexapod Eradicator, a walker with long range attack, great for breaking defenses.
